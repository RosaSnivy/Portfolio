# May Ferin Technical Portfolio
Hello! I am May Ferin and this is my technical Portfolio.

In late 2024 I had a project where I made many razor pages to showcase the characters and stats in a Discord bot I am in the process of making. I implemented paging, sorting, etc. to the razor pages.

Here is the link to the repository.

Also attached is my midterm project from a class in the same semester as the last one. It is a website for a made up company that sells dubious devices.

I am currently working on two certifications through Coursera, being Game Design and Project Management.
